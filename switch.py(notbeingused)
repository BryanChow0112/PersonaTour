        2. Specific tourist location and not just a city name but shop/attraction names and a brief description. make sure to suggest enough locations based on the duration given.
        3. A route in which the user can travel to said destinations
        4. Reason of suggesting the destinations based on the mbti, hobby and age of the user.
